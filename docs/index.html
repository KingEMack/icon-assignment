      <p> The local restaurant and bar, O Lavrador, has been extremely fortunate to excel during this pandemic due to their abundance of returning customers and use of space on their
        property. “If it wasn't for our local support we would close, but we don’t believe in that even if it went into savings. We have the benefit of being open for almost 40 years and lucky to have our parking lot that helps us with having the
        space necessary to serve the amount of people that want to come eat or drink,” said Edgar Ferreira, Owner of O Lavrador. The family owned restaurant values their seniority of being the one of the oldest restaurants in the neighborhood serving
        good food and service, over their undermanaged social media presence. “My family has been eating at O Lavrador for over 20 years, and we love the ambiance and service. This restaurant feels like extended family and even when take out was the
        only option we made a point to continue to provide our support,” said Michelle Duarte, Queens resident.</p>

      <p> Locals have been supporting their favorite restaurants independently, but if community officials want to see a bigger impact then they need to implement a community wide incentive.
        “I have been making it a point to support local restaurants especially if their Black Owned but I am only one person. Covid has impacted everyone's pockets differently, and now more than ever, I understand the value of where I spend my money.
        I even push my friends to do the same, because when this pandemic is over I still want to be able to go to my favorite neighborhood spots,” said Nakiya Henry, Queens Resident. </p>

      <p> Not every restaurant has the advantage of neighborhood seniority, ample outdoor space, or a viral social media presence. During this time it is important that locals continue
        to make an effort to support local restaurants. If local support is the answer to sustainability in the restaurant industry then a community movement is needed. </p>
